# NavigatorEngine
a game engine made in java and lwjgl for my upcoming large-scale game project

- **why not csharp?** i have no experience with it, but i have a little bit of java experience, so i chose what i know the best
- **java has bad game performance, just look at minecraft!** minecraft has badly written engine, it should've been completely rewrtitten from ground up on late beta stages

engine specifications as well as overall implementation are yet to be decided
